# Pi Charge Controller Setup

This repository extends a Pi already running `dendro-pi-main` by adding support for logging and uploading solar charge controller data. 
The file is saved in CSV format with a timestamp to differentiate each day's data for the upload script.
It also controls a relay to turn on/off a load based on the charge controller temperature.

The default behaviour of this system is to log the charge controller data every 5 minutes and upload it to Dropbox every 30 minutes.

Example output of the CSV file:
| Timestamp           | Controller Temp (Â°C) | Battery Voltage (V) | State of Charge (%) | Relay State (On=True) | Solar Voltage (V) | Solar Current (A) | Solar Power (W) | Battery Temp (Â°C) | Max Solar Today (W) | Min Solar Today (W) | Max Battery V Today (V) | Min Battery V Today (V) |

## ðŸ”§ Physical Setup instructions
### 1. Connect the Solar Charge Controller to the Raspberry Pi
- The RJ12 adapter connects to the RS232 port on the charge controller.
- The other end of the RJ12 adapter has 6 screw terminals. We only need to connect 3 of them:
  - **Pin 1**: Connect to the **RX** pin of the Waveshare USB to RS232/485 Serial Converter.
  - **Pin 2**: Connect to the **TX** pin of the Waveshare USB to RS232/485 Serial Converter.
  - **Pin 3**: Connect to the **GND** pin of the Waveshare USB to RS232/485 Serial Converter.
  #### Note: The pins are numbered from left to right when looking at the RJ12 connector with the screw terminals facing you. 
  #### Note2: The RX and TX pins are reversed, so make sure to connect them correctly.
- The Waveshare USB to RS232/485 Serial Converter connects to the Raspberry Pi via USB.
  - If using a Raspberry Pi Zero W, you will need the USB to Micro USB adapter.

### 2. Connect the Relay
- The relay is connected to the Raspberry Pi header pins.
  - Wire the relay as follows:
    - **IN**: Connect to GPIO pin 10 (or any other GPIO pin you prefer). ***If you use a different GPIO pin, you will need to change the variable ```RELAY_PIN = 10``` in ```command_line.py```***
    - **GND**: Connect to a ground pin on the Raspberry Pi.


## ðŸ”§ Raspberry Pi Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
cd ~/dendro-pi-main  # Must already exist
git clone https://github.com/alanfogel/ChargeController.git
cd ChargeController
```

### 2. Run the Setup Script  
##### (This may take several minutes)
```bash
bash setup.sh
```

### 3. Update the dropbox folder name in `upload-to-dropbox_SOLAR.sh`
```bash
nano upload-to-dropbox_SOLAR.sh
```
- Change line 5: ```DROPBOX_FOLDER="/Dorval-Solar_TEST```
to your desired folder name, e.g., `DROPBOX_FOLDER="/Dorval-Solar"`.

### Manual Steps (if setup script fails)
1. Install the required Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Update renogymodbus manually (if not automated):
```bash
cp command_line.py venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/renogymodbus/command_line.py
```

3. Install Crontab Jobs
```bash
crontab -e
```
- Add the following lines to the crontab file:
```bash
# Upload Charge Controller Data every day (3am)
3 0 * * * sh /home/madlab/dendro-pi-main/upload-to-dropbox.sh

# Take Solar Charge Controller measurements every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * /home/madlab/charge_controller/venv/bin/renogymodbus --device charge_controller --portname /dev/ttyUSB0 --slaveaddress 1
```

## Instructions for Using the Relay
1. Open the `command_line.py` file:
```bash
nano command_line.py
```
2. Find the lines that set the temperature thresholds for the relay:
```python
TEMP_ON_THRESHOLD = 23
TEMP_OFF_THRESHOLD = 24
```

3. Adjust the values of `TEMP_ON_THRESHOLD` and `TEMP_OFF_THRESHOLD` to your desired temperature thresholds. 
   - The relay will turn on when the charge controller temperature exceeds `TEMP_ON_THRESHOLD` and will turn off when it falls below `TEMP_OFF_THRESHOLD`.

4. If you want to change what triggers the relay, you can modify the logic in the function `print_charge_controller_output()` 
   ````python
   def print_charge_controller_output(args):
       # ... existing code ...
           relay_state = None
            if controller_temp > TEMP_ON_THRESHOLD:
               set_relay(True)
               relay_state = True
            elif controller_temp < TEMP_OFF_THRESHOLD:
               set_relay(False)
               relay_state = False
       # ... existing code ...
   ````
   
   - For example, you can change the condition to check for battery voltage or state of charge instead of temperature by modifying the `if` statements accordingly.


5. Save the file and exit the editor (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

## Troubleshooting
1. ```minimalmodbus.NoResponseError: No communication with the instrument (no answer)```
   - The ```slaveaddress #``` argument in crontab may be in correct. The default is 1, but it may be different for your setup. A previous setup I had used the address 17.

2. If the relay is not working as expected:
   - Ensure the relay is connected to the correct GPIO pin, or change the `RELAY_PIN` variable in `command_line.py` to match your setup.
